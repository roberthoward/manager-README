I am Rob Howard, UX Engineering Director within the Thomson Reuters Design (https://trten.sharepoint.com/sites/DesignOperations) - Design UX Engineering. I began my career at Thomson Reuters in 2013 as a software engineer in the Tax & Accounting business segment. I am a native of Dallas, Texas in the United States and headquartered at the Carrollton - Thomson Reuters HQ office in the Central time zone (CST). Please view this README as a representation of my managerial philosophy.

It's going to take a solid quarter to fully figure our working relationship out. I understand the importance of first impressions, and I know you want to get a check in the win column, but this is a complex place full of equally complex humans. Take your time, meet everyone, go to every meeting, write things down, and ask all the questions – especially about all the TR acronyms, cross-functional teams, and project code names.

One of the working relationships we need to define is ours. The following is a user guide for me and how I work. It captures what you can expect out of the average week working with me, how I like to work, my north star principles, and some of my, uh, nuance. My intent is to accelerate our working relationship with this document.

This is my Manager README, a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, though anyone is free to read it - or even provide feedback on it! Please treat it as a reference and promise on how I will conduct myself as a manager and leader, and what I expect from you.

I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises, and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Without your guidance, I will not be able to improve as a manager and leader.

Having been inspired by various posts on the importance of transparency, communication and openness from the leadership side of engineering, I’ve decided to kick things off here with a living document to aid development of our relationship. An accompanying PowerPoint deck is also available for [review here](https://trten-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/rob_howard_thomsonreuters_com/ETbwKYE_TBtLsVHv48-vNPYBQ9wFxTkoTe7Oc8VZgamssA?e=DGWpJB).

# First off, welcome! 
This README is an earnest, incomplete (we never stop growing) and concise guide. It sets both my expectations for you and a base-line for your expectations of me. If you like the general thinking behind this document, please create one for yourself. It can go well beyond just the working relationship with me and your peers and provide a good jumping off point for conversations around self-awareness.

I wrote this document to share my expectations on what would make it most effective to work together, and so that you can hold me accountable for it. Use this document as an intro into my mind and how I like to operate: my mental and operational frameworks. I believe that these topics would help you become more effective and reduce managerial overhead on my side.

We’ll spend our operational touchpoints to get to know each other a bit better, of course.

In short, I want you to get to know me a little bit and make sure you know how I think and work.

It is meant to work as a presentation, as well as something to be able to read without me talking about it. That being said, I will walk you through at least once. Please remind me if that hasn’t happened yet.

This is a living document, which will change. Please let me know if you have any feedback on how to make this more useful to you and the next person.

Welcome to my User Guide to Working with me! I offer this to you because I recognize that the faster we get to know each other and how we work, the better and stronger our relationship will be, and the more we’ll accomplish together. I encourage you to write your own User Guide so I and your team can learn how to work best with you. This is a living document that will change as I learn more about myself and how we can best support each other.

# UX Engineering (UXE) Tenets 

**Prioritize experiences over features.** Our modular, scalable, and reusable capabilities deliver solutions for our customers' most common and challenging needs.

**Design is not a matter of taste or opinion.** We are objective and never assume we know better. Excellence in design is achieved through customer insights and data.

**Build experiences that are accessible, inclusive, and global.** Our solutions support all our customers regardless of ability, background, or location.

**Deliver simple experiences for complex problems.** Our solutions provide users with clear pathways so they can move confidently through their workflows.

**Release, measure, iterate. Repeat.** Perfect is the enemy of good. The sooner customers experience our solutions, the faster we learn. Those learnings inform future iterations.

# Understanding My Role

[The engineering method is] the strategy for causing the best change in a poorly understood or uncertain situation within the available resources and those resources dependent to deliver QCD (Quality, Cost, and Delivery Speed). How can we have it all, you ask? The Answer: Setting our north star principles on "Quality" first.

While quality is first, there are a number of things I will be responsible for and 2 things that take higher priority than everything else.

The first is empowering the engineers I manage (as well as influencing the engineers I don't manage) to make the biggest impact possible for and at Thomson Reuters while reaching their professional development goals.

The second is consistently deliverying user/customer experiences that solve user/customer pain-points on time (within realistic time expectations) and with the highest in quality standards. Remember quality usually cannot be rushed, but it can be optimized for.

If the business is healthy, and our engineering efforts are on-time, and the teams are motivated, challenged, and moving towards their professional development goals, then all is right in my world.

A large part of my day will involve collaborating with various people from multiple disciplines from design, technology engineering, product, recruiting, marketing, program management, support, 1x1's (one on ones) or 1:many (aka general meetings).

My work also involves working with multiple agile pods and a decreasing number of waterfall teams, but because I am not an individual contributor nor a first-line manager, I am not directly part of an agile delivery team. As a result, it's less about day-to-day operations, but more about business strategy from a technology perspective, long-term goals, growth, culture and the likes.

# Feedback
I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

At Thomson Reuters, there is a formal feedback cycle that occurs twice a year. The first time we go through this cycle, we’ll draft a proposed set of OKRs for you for the next review period. These are not product or technology OKRs; these are professional growth OKRs for you. I’ll send you these draft OKRs as well as upward feedback from your team before we meet so you can review them beforehand.

In our face-to-face meeting, we’ll discuss and agree on your OKRs for the next period, and I’ll ask for feedback on my performance. At our following review, the process differs thusly: I’ll review you against our prior OKRs, and I’ll introduce new OKRs (if necessary). Rinse and repeat.

Review periods are not the only time we’ll exchange feedback. This will be a recurring topic in our 1:1s. I am going to ask you for feedback in 1:1s regularly. I am never going to stop doing this no matter how many times you say you have no feedback for me.

Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.


# Meetings
**Meeting etiquitte** Follow these common rules for proper meeting etiquette: 1) Be punctual. 2) Come prepared. 3) Speak loud enough. 4) Actively listen and participate. 5) Take turns speaking. 6) Follow the agenda. 7) Ask questions at the appropriate time. 8) Be attentive to your body language. 9) Focus, eliminating distractions. 10) If you're hosting a meeting be sure to let everyone know what the meeting is about, followed at the end with concrete action items. If for any reason you have a meeting with me and you need to reschedule or cancel, please notify as early as possible so that we are able to reschedule or cancel.

**I go to a lot of meetings.** I deliberately run with my calendar publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.

**My definition of a meeting includes an agenda and/or intended purpose,** the appropriate amount of productive attendees, and a responsible party running the meeting to a schedule. If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer to start on time. If I am running a meeting, I will start that meeting on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance.

**Importance of virtual meeting video.** Love it or hate it, video is important to your career, and you'll need to use it regularly and turn it on - perhaps more than you want to - for a number of reasons. 1) Video demonstrates responsibility, 2) video demonstrates confidence, 3) video builds trust and rapport, 4) video helps you engage, 5) video makes you memorable, and 6) video sets the meeting's tone.

**Pre-meeting information review** If you send me a presentation deck a reasonable amount of time before a meeting (at least a day or 2), I will read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. If I haven’t read the deck, I will tell you.

**If a meeting completes its intended purpose before its scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone.** If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

**Please check your calendar for day of meetings.** I promise that I will do everything in my power to avoid sending last minute meetings to your calendar. With that said, there will often be times that meetings will appear last minute and you may be required to attend due to the nature of the meeting. I typically will include information in the foward stating if the meeting is required or optional. If you're unable to attend due to conflicting schedules, please notify me via Teams or email of your unavailability. 


# Career Development
* Your career is yours.
* I will coach, I will offer feedback.
* I will provide you with outside perspective. You may know where you want to be, but when you’re living it in the moment it can be hard to see if there’s a gap and where.
* I will partner with you to line up the opportunities needed for the growth you are targeting.
* But at the end of the day, it’s your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. You determine whether you make the time to get there.
* I try very hard to hire leaders that I would like to work for myself and are meaningfully better than me at the function you lead. As a result, it’s unlikely I will be a mentor to you in your role. My biggest value to you is to be a strong vocal advocate for your success, get you the resources you need to be successful, empower you to make impact without friction, remove any blockers to your success, lead and foster collaboration amongst the leadership team to align on a strategy that maximizes our impact, and surround you with a team of peers that inspire you. You are the top person in the company in your function and my role as a mentor can be to 1) give you transparency into my role if you endeavor to become a Manager/Director, 2) help connect you with people in the company that are leaders in your function, 3) change your role to help you change/increase your scope of responsibility/influence if you are performing and that is your goal, 4) create an environment where you can perform and feel fulfilled. I commit to doing all of these and expect you to hold me accountable if you don’t feel sufficiently supported. 
* I’m highly results-oriented and as a result, it’s not my first instinct to focus on professional development. I will do my best, but it will benefit you to clearly communicate your professional goals

> "No one hands you personal growth here; but it's there for the taking. It's being able to try hard things; that you might not succeed at every time. It's seeing the practices of the talented people around you; practices that you're free to steal. Or it's the advice that others will give to you; advice that you didn't always ask for but is usually a good idea to take."

* Your career is yours. You know best how you’d like to grow and in what areas. I can provide feedback and an outside perspective.

* I’ll do my best to provide growth and learning opportunities, it’ll be up to you to seize them. Let’s work together on this.

* At the end of the day, it is your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. Let me know how I can help you achieve them.


# What do I value most?
* **I know it's hard to believe, but I am an introvert** and that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me. Weird, huh? Meetings with three of us are perfect, three to eight are ok, and more than eight you will find that I am strangely quiet. Try not to confuse my quiet with lack of engagement.

* **Respect and Appreciation**. I always try my best to show the upmost respect when engaging with my co-workers, but if the respect is not recipricated I will gladly share my feedback.

* **When the Operational 1:1 touchpoint feels over, and there is remaining time** I always have a couple of meaty topics to discuss. This is brainstorming, and the issues are usually front-of-mind hard topics that I am processing. It might feel like we’re shooting the shit, but we’re doing real work.

* **When I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

* **Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“Rob, can you help me with X?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (“Rob, do X and I expect it to be done by the end of the week.”) I have been this way since I was a kid growing up.

* **I can sometimes go on and on and over time in our discussions,** my spouse and children remind me of this all the time - but it’s almost always because I am excited about the topic, if this happens and I'm cutting into time you need, please don't hesitate to jump in and tell me that you have to run. I also swear sometimes. Sorry :).

* I love to start new things but I often lose interest when I can mentally see how the thing is going to finish which might be weeks or months before the thing is actually done. Sorry. I’m working on this.

* If I am on my phone during a meeting for more than 30 seconds, say something. My attention wanders.

* Humans stating opinions as facts are a trigger for me.

* Humans who are good at identifying problems, but lowsy at identifying solutions are also a trigger for me.


# Our Average Week
* We’ll have operational 1:1 touchpoints according to schedule for at least 30 minutes except during HIGH ALERT (See below). This meeting discusses topics of substance, not updates. We can leverage our running shared doc for the two us of to capture future topics for our operational touchpoints as well as to provide a handy historic record of what we’ve discussed. When you or I think of a topic, we can dump it into the document.

* For leads. We’ll have weekly leadership staff meetings with your peers every week for 30 minutes no matter what. Unlike operational 1:1s, we have a shared document or dashboard that captures agenda topics for discussion. Similar to operational touchpoints, we aren’t discussing status at this meeting, but successes and issues of substance that affect the team.

* You can send Teams messages to me during my office hours (10:00am - 6pm ET). I like responding quickly unless I am in a meeting or in deep thought. I typically check my email at the start of my day, mid-way through, and an hour before the end of the day.

* If I am traveling, I will give you notice of said travel in advance. All our meetings still occur albeit with time zone considerations.

* I typically reserve weekends strictly for family time and to evolve my technical skills. This is my choice. I do not expect that you are going to work or conduct your learnings on the weekend. I might email you things, but unless the thing says URGENT, it can always wait until work begins for you on Monday.

* I take vacations. You should, too. Disconnected from work is when I do some of my best work.


# North Star Principles
* **Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic product. I optimize for the humans. Other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any other number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards action and building productive humans.

* **Leadership comes from everywhere.** My wife likes to remind me that I hated meetings for the first ten years of my professional career. She’s right. I’ve wasted a lot of time in poorly run meetings by bad managers. As an engineer, I remain skeptical of managers even as a manager. While I believe managers are an essential part of a scaling organization, I don’t believe they have a monopoly on leadership, and I work hard to build other constructs and opportunities in our teams for non-managers to effectively lead.

* **I see things as systems.** I reduce all complex things (including humans) into systems. I think in flow charts and pictures. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and flowcharts all fit together. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

* **It is important to me that humans are treated fairly.** I believe that most humans are trying to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity.

* **I am heavily biased towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

* **I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.** I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time.

* **I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.** This has worked out well for me over my career.

* **I need you to know that sometimes we are on HIGH ALERT and things will get strange.** There is an exception to many of my practices and principles and that is when we are in a HIGH ALERT situation. HIGH ALERT conditions usually involve existential threats to our company and its assets. During this time, my usual people, process, and product protocols are secondary to countering this threat. If it is not obvious, I will alert you that I am in this state along with my best guess of when we’ll be done. If I am constantly in this state, something is fundamentally wrong.


# Taking Time Off
* We all should take time off and take advantage of the vacation time available to us throughout the year. Please use the time available to you throughout the year as this is the best way to replenish your batteries.
* Use the time off or loose it. Avoid stocking up on time off and attempting to request time off at the end of the year. Each year, many individuals attempt to take all of their time off in December and find that due to a lack of coverage, their request is not approved.
* If you're not feeling well, I advise to communicate with your team leads, immediate scrum team, delivery manager to let them know you're feeling ill, followed by and update to our main teams chat and Workday request. It is important that you communicate when you'll be unavailable. Sometimes it may take time for me to approve the request in WorkDay, but rest assured if you're sick take the time off and once I have the opportunity to manage the Workday request, I will approve the sick request.
* Please for vacations and other schedule time off, please request in WorkDay at least 2 weeks in advance after speaking with your tech lead, immediate scrum team, and delivery manager. I will ask you if you've completed these steps first and once I have received this updated information I then will approve. Once approved, please immediately block the time out in your calendar which will help to prevent others from scheduling meetings when you're out. 
* If you're looking to schedule more than a single week off at a time, let's discuss first (reach out via teams or email) and please ensure your tech lead and immediate delivery team is aware prior to submitting the request. 


# Personality quirks
* I discuss with “passion” - I may appear to raise my voice a little I've been told. I don’t like it about myself, and I try to improve. I tell myself that “I’m all-in, all the time” but it’s just me losing my temper. When you feel I crossed the line, please tell me. It’s not my intent.
* When you ask “do you have 5 minutes?” in Teams or email, please add the topic you’d like to discuss, otherwise, I’ll think “do you have 5 minutes for me to tell you I’m thinking of quitting.” -- we’re biased for bad news and I’m not different.
* From the Tech leaders in the org I expect to create the reality they’d like to see - tell me what you plan to do, instead of waiting for me to offer a way or shape reality for you. If you’re stuck, tell me and I’ll help. You’re the driver.
* I am a big believer in “no broken windows” when building products: I like clean logs, clean exceptions, clean PagerDuty. Once things go south here it’s very hard to truly understand the health of the system. 
* I tend to write direct to the point and save longer discussions for a call to scale my time. I can be hard to read: This is not intentional. I mean what I say. A non-response means I do not have a response (and also no judgement). If you are unsure what I’m thinking, just ask (again, transparency)
* I can get stressed out: When this happens, I may be short, or slow to respond with you. Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will address it.
* I have a tendency to try to solution: In discussions, I can keep pushing a point because I think it’s right, not because it objectively is. Please call me out on it if you feel this is happening and I will address it.
* I have had problems in the past with not doing a good job sharing knowledge: When I first started managing, I would not pass on knowledge of systems. I would take certain pieces of complex work because it was easiest for me to do it. This disempowers the team. This prevents you from having the opportunity to grow. This makes me stressed out
* I have strong opinions, weakly held.  I love to debate and hear all positions, understand and see an issue from all sides.  Question everything I say, we’ll all be better for it.
* I care about my words and endeavor to choose them carefully.  I take this too far sometimes, overthinking my words at times.  
* I love to brainstorm and often ask for feedback on ideas.  I may forget to explain this, so always assume I’m brainstorming with you. I default to clarity when giving direction, not when brainstorming. This is especially important when I get crazy ideas.


# My Interest
Here are some things I love. If you ever want to shoot the breeze and don't know what to talk about, these are a few good bets :)

* Family and raising a family. My wife [parks & rec / community], my 2 children (Robbie [computer science] - age 17 and Jada age 15 [medical, legal] ) along with our furbaby (Princess - age 8 / Rocky - at age 11 passed Jan 2, 2022) are my joy and give me life every single day. I'm always happy to pick up new parenting tips as well as sharing tips.

<img src = "https://github.com/roberthoward/manager-README/blob/main/family.jpg" width="200">

* Type 1 Diabetes. My family (my daughter Jada) was diagnosed with this life changing disease in 2015 after my daughter's 8th birthday. Since then, my family and I have been active members of the Junior Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) organization where I also serve on the community board.

<img src = "https://github.com/roberthoward/manager-README/blob/main/jdrf-onewalk2017.PNG" width="200">

* Serial Entreprenuership. In my former life, I served as co-founder for several startups. My start up endevors include - DallasPeeps.com, PartyChaser.com, Nupes.com as well as a few other endevors I have under my belt.

<img src = "https://github.com/roberthoward/manager-README/blob/main/DallasPeeps%20Newspaper%20Cover.jpg" width="200">

* I also spend my time volunteering as a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, an African American fraternal organization founded in 1911 on the campus of Indian University, as well as serving as a member of the Mosier Valley Prince Hall Masonry, a branch of North American Freemasonry for African Americans founded by Prince Hall on September 29, 1784.

<img src = "https://github.com/roberthoward/manager-README/blob/main/20190214_121325.jpg" width="200">

* Diversity and Inclusion. As you may be able to tell, I'm an American and member of the African American community and can say that I have not been immune to discrimination  in my past. I serve as advisor to the local Black Employee Network (BEN) Thomson Reuters business resource group. I implore anyone seeking insight into this community to feel comfortable reaching out to me rather it's helping to share a job req to chatting about how you can be an ally. I'm always looking at opportunities to conversate and bridge the gap between diversity and inclusion at TR. I recently kicked off a teams channel within Digital called "The Water Cooler" to provide a safe space for people to share things happening in the news affecting different groups, as well as talk about topics that help to bridge the gap. In addition I spend my time on the community board for Blacks In Technology (BIT) DFW as well as Black Tutors of Social Media.
* Technology. I'm always trying to stay ahead of the curve in technology and innovation. My weekends, when not spending time with family or friends, is spent learning on sites like udemy.com, coursera.com, educative.io to name a few. I've started to explore Machine Learning and AI (on the surface) and also helping my son in his current pursuit of getting in Computer Science once he lives high school. I aspire to build something that I can learn from so I'm challenging myself with building out an app that includes multiple distributed services.

# Thank You
Thank you for taking the time to review my README. This document is new and still a work in progress. I’d love your feedback
